This is a Test File
list.addAll(words);
Now you would want to compare the retrieved list against a Master list containing all your records.

// Compare the 2 lists, assuming your file list has less number of
// records
masterList.removeAll(list);
The above statement can be used in reverse too; in case the file holds the master list of words. Alternatively, you can store the 2 lists in temporary lists and compare in whatsoever way your require.

Here is the complete code:

public static void main(String[] args) {
        String line;

        // List of all the words read from the file
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        // Your original mast list of words against which you want to compare
        List<String> masterList = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("cleaner",
                "code", "java", "read", "write", "market", "python", "snake",
                "stack", "overflow"));

        BufferedReader reader;

        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("testing.txt"));

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                // Add all the words split by a ; to the list
                List<String> words = Arrays.asList(line.split(";"));
                list.addAll(words);
            }

            // Compare the 2 lists, assuming your file list has less number of
            // records
            masterList.removeAll(list);

            System.out.println(masterList);

            reader.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
